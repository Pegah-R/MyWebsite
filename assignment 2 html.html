    <p> Assignment 2: Parametrics and Generation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="AssignmentDiscription">
    <p>This assignment is a series of 21 sketches, which were done every day for three weeks. This practice of daily sketching is a way to gradually build our skills in working with p5.js, which in the end add up to be significant. These daily sketches do not all have to be completely different they could be improved or changed versions of each other that were done the day or days before. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I've had a bit of experience working with javascript in high school, which helped me quite a lot with understating more complicated codes.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a class, we all agreed on a statement, which had 26 letters. Each letter was then assigned to each person and the sketches were done based on that letter, and I was assigned “N”. 
      The letters are then put together to make a poster, and using the Risograph method to print the poster in one tone or one color.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  The phrase agreed by the class: I see trees; green, red roses too.

      <p1>Day 1</p1>
      	<div class="p1">
        	<p>This was the first sketch created, on day 1, and it was the first thing I learned after the basics. To draw with the shapes was very intriguing to me, so I decided to start my sketches with this. 
			The shape, however, was accidental, I was playing around with the circle and thought to add something to the shapes, like a line. Since I didn't know how to yet, I added ovals instead of lines.
 			<br>
			<br>
			After seeing what I can draw with it, I came up with what you see on the right.

      <p1>Day 2 </p1>
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>By this time, we were assigned letters to sketch with, and at first, I wanted to simply add my letter to the screen.

    <p1>Day 3</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This sketch was done using a tutorial on how to randomly draw squares on top of each other on a spot. I then took that and put a few of them together to create an “N”.

  <p1>Day 4</p1>
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>To further improve the last sketch I decided to add two bigger squares to the background, with slightly different colors. It was really interesting to see that the sketch looked very different as time went on and more squares were drawn on top of each other.
			<br>
			<br>
			One thing I tried to do after this day was, to create sketches like this, that look different in different stages and at different times, with a lot of movements

    <p1>Day 5</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day I decided to change the previous sketch even further. It looked like the colors after a while blended together and create a new color, so I decided to use that In this new sketch.

    <p1>Day 6</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>For this sketch, I found out that we can specify how fast random colors are drawn, so I used that to create this sketch. The slow color change of the circles creates a low opacity and creates an interesting design when they overlap.

    <p1>Day 7</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This was taken from a tutorial, that draws a specific color line where the mouse is, but when clicked the color would change. Originally the colors were not like the one I created. I decided to have the second color be the same as the background color so the design drawn can be erased.

    <p1>Day 8</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This was inspired by another tutorial. The original sketch was called “decay” and the color of the dots was the same as the background, which would then “decay” the word or the letter. I decided to add color to the sketch and came up with the above. As time goes on the letter gets buried under the dots and eventually disappears.

    <p1>Day 9</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day, I used the slowly random colors mentioned in sketch 6 to slowly add color to the letter and the background.

    <p1>Day 10</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This sketch was taken from a tutorial, However, I changed the color of the moving circles, to randomly chosen colors.

    <p1>Day 11</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This sketch was also from a tutorial. The shivering “N” would be placed by change when taking a screenshot, which I found very interesting.

    <p1>Day 12</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day I looked at sketches 8 and 9 and decided to move the “N” above the appearing circles, so slowly the Balck “N” reveals itself.

    <p1>Day 13</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>Similar to day 11, the two “N”s together, would be placed randomly in relation to each other when taking a screenshot, and I would get interesting results.

		<div class="p1">
        	<p>For this day I decided to play around with positive and negative space with the two “N”s, building on the last sketch.

  <p1>Day 15</p1>
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This sketch was from a tutorial, and the movement you get when the “N” is trying to avoid the cursor is very interesting.

	<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day I found a tutorial on this, The movement of the letter was something I did not do before so it was intriguing to me. I changed the colors and ended up with this sketch.

  	<p1>Day 17</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day I decided to play around with the code of the last sketch, to explore and learn how the wavy lines are achieved. By changing a few numbers I ended up with this sketch.

  	<p1>Day 18</p1>
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On this day, I was deciding on the sketch to submit for the poster and was thinking of color themes for my sketch. I decided to take the sketch from day 12 and add a color theme to it by restricting the range which the random colors are chosen from.

  	<p1>Day 19</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>For this sketch, I wanted to have lower case letters, which was something I didn't have in other sketches and came up with this.

  	<p1>Day 20</p1>	
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>This sketch was from a tutorial as well, I found that with this code circles can be drawn on a line. I took that created four of those lines to highlight the letter “n” which is the same color as the background. This creates a silhouette of the letter.

  	<p1>Day 21</p1>
		<div class="p1">
        	<p>On the last day, I wanted to have something that would use the keyboard as its input. I found this sketch, and then changed the placement of the “N”. The results are dependent on what keys are used and something the shapes left behind create an interesting composition with the new shapes
